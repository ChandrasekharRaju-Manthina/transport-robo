We developed this application as part of my current  company's internal coding competition. We got second prize :)

We named it as <b>transport robo</b> as we use it for transport management. Some of the options includes generating trip sheet, 
submitting pick up and drop requests, shuttle maangement, drivers details etc. And we used <b>Google Maps API</b> for calculating the 
travel distance and time durations.
